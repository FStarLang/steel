type framing_failure = {

}

(* t is well-typed in g at c, where the context has ctxt:vprop.

   Tries to transform the context ctxt to ctxt',
   by applying various proof steps, including:
     * Introducing existential and pure vprops
     * Unfolding and folding definitions
     * Calling into F* to prove that certain terms are provably equal.
   Such that
      ctxt' has the form c.pre * frame

   Returns an elaboration of t, preceding it with the necessary proof steps
   and a proof that the elaboration is well-typed in the oringal context
   
   Or, a framing failure, showing which conjuncts of the c.pre could not be
   derived
