(**
  * This is a port of Zeta.Steel.HashAccumulator to Pulse
  *
  * It models a kind of multiset hash where the the hash value is a cumulative
  * XOR of an underlying hash (from Blake2b) plus a counter that records
  * the number of elements that have been cumualtively hashed so far.
  *
  * It exercises several Pulse features, notably
  *   - Nested records of references and arrays
  *   - Folding & unfolding
  *   - While loops
  *   - Ghost functions
  *   - Use of F* lemmas in Pulse code
  *
  * It is simpler than the Steel version in various ways, as described below.
  *
  * Summarizing:
  *   - The use of erased values is significantly simpler here
  *   - Loops are easier and more structured
  *   - There are fewer rewrites and manipulations of existentials
  *
  * Author: N. Swamy
